# Brightwayz Tavus Demo

This project is a conversational video demo that brings together real human guidance and service discovery. It connects people to community resources through an AI-powered interface that feels approachable, visual, and supportive. The goal was to make something that feels more like a friendly conversation than a database search.

## Background

After years of working with nonprofits and county agencies across the Bay Area, I saw how often people in need were met with confusing systems, long forms, or outdated tools. Those experiences shaped how I approached this demo. Instead of optimizing for speed or flash, I focused on clarity, empathy, and trust.

## Technology

This app is built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Tavus's CVI. It uses a local dataset of Alameda County resources and combines video, search, and filtering in one interactive experience. Users can ask questions, see relevant services, and get visual feedback in real time.

## Local Setup

Clone the repo, install dependencies, create .env.local file and add env variables shown in .env.example

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```
